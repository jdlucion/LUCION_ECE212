    "Python is a high-level programing language like other programing languages such as C++, PHP, and Java. Machine and assembly languages are belong to low-level programing languages, they can only execute at low-level language. One of the main disadvantage of a high-level languages is that it will consume more time on processing the program before it can run, but it has many advantages though. High-level languages are much easier\tto\tprogram, take less time to write, shorter and easier to\tread, more likely to be correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the difference between the high-level languages and low-level languages is their portability. High-level languages can run on different computers while low-level languages can only run on one computer. Almost\tall\tprograms are written in\thigh-level languages. Low-level languages are used\tonly for a few specialized\tapplications.\n",

    "Interpreters and compilers are the two kinds of high-level languages into low-level languages. An interpreter does what the program says and take less time on processing the program. A compiler reads\t the\t program\t and\t translates\tit\t completely\t before\t the\t program\t starts running.\tIn\tthis\tcase,\tthe\thigh-level\tprogram\tis\tcalled\tthe source\tcode,\tand\tthe\ttranslated program\tis\tcalled\tthe object\tcode or\tthe executable.\tOnce\ta\tprogram\tis\tcompiled,\tyou\tcan execute\tit\trepeatedly\twithout\tfurther\ttranslation.\n",
